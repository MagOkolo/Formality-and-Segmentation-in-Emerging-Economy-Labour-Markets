# Formality-and-Segmentation-in-Emerging-Economy-Labour-Markets
These codes replicate results from Garcia Lazaro, Martin and Okolo (2024): "Segmentation of the UK Labour Market". The codes are written in Matlab and Stata.

Figures 1) and 2) are generated by running "run_new_mexico_clustering_baseline.m" in MATLAB.

The results are obtained by running "run_new_mexico_clustering_baseline.m" in Matlab, followed by "mexico_results_wage_data.do" in Stata.

The results in Tables 1) - 3) are generated by running "mexico_results_wage_data.do" in Stata.

Figure 3) is generated by running "wage_distribution_mexico.m" in MATLAB.

Table 4) is generated by running "mexico_results_wage_data_te.do" in Stata.
